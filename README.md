# NBA- 2020/21 Player Scoring summary

This repository contains the csv files and the MySQL code that I used to create a summary of 
2 point, 3 point, and freethow data from the 2020/21 season.

This visualization displays player scoring from the 2020/21 NBA season. The top orange row is two bar charts showing the top 10 players in that's category, and below in blue is their respective accuracy shooting those shots. The heat map shows the same 10 players but with a heat map to show how many they made. Finally, the bottom in light blue is a bar chart displaying all the teams in the NBA and how many of each shot they made summed over all their players.

Examples of insights we can take away form this visualization:

- We see that Trae Young is first in free throws made. This makes a lot of sense as this is one of the core elements of Trae's playstyle, drawing fouls and getting
  free throws
- In the bottom left, the Los Angles Lakers were among some of the worst three point shooting teams, this is inline with the fact that last season the Lakers traded   away many of their core three point shooters from last year, starving them of that depth this year.
- In the two point collumn Luka Doncic is amongst the top 10 for 2 point scoring in the league, however you see that Dallas Mavericks (Dal) are in the back half of   the league. This constrast is due to the fact that Luka did is vast majority of Dallas's scoring and carried much of the offensive load this season.
